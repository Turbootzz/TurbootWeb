# Turboot Web

Website for my portfolio and personal projects.

## Why this website?

I like to try new things. This is my first website in NextJS.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
